## Architecture Components

### 1. eBPF Probe Layer
The eBPF Probe Layer attaches to the Linux kernel and MongoDB processes to collect detailed performance data:

- **File I/O Probe**: Monitors read/write operations in the WiredTiger storage engine
- **Network Probe**: Tracks MongoDB wire protocol traffic and network latency
- **Query Probe**: Monitors query execution, including planning and documents examined
- **CPU/Memory Probe**: Tracks resource utilization at both process and thread level
- **Lock Probe**: Monitors lock acquisitions, wait times, and contention

### 2. Metrics Collection & Processing Layer
The Metrics Collection & Processing Layer processes raw data from eBPF probes:

- **Event Processor**: Aggregates and correlates events from different probes
- **Metrics Exporter**: Exposes metrics in Prometheus format
- **Anomaly Detector**: Identifies unusual patterns in database behavior
- **Local Storage**: Retains raw event data for detailed analysis

### 3. Monitoring Infrastructure
The Monitoring Infrastructure provides visualization, alerting, and analysis:

- **Prometheus**: Time-series database for metrics storage
- **Grafana**: Dashboards for performance visualization
- **AlertManager**: Notification system for performance issues
- **Management Console**: Central administration interface

```

## Dashboards & Visualization

The solution includes pre-configured Grafana dashboards for monitoring various aspects of MongoDB performance:

### MongoDB Performance Overview Dashboard
- Query performance metrics
- Operation counts by type and collection
- I/O and network performance
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, connections)
- Slow query analysis
- Query efficiency metrics

### WiredTiger Analysis Dashboard
- Cache usage and hit ratio
- Block operations
- Checkpoint performance
- Concurrent transactions
- Session operations

### Replica Set Monitoring Dashboard

## Alert Rules & Notifications

The solution includes pre-configured alert rules for common MongoDB performance issues:

- High query latency
- Low query efficiency
- I/O bottlenecks
- Connection saturation
- Replication lag
- Memory pressure
- Lock contention
- Missing indexes

Alerts can be delivered via multiple channels:
- Email
- Slack
- PagerDuty
- Webhook integrations
- SMS (via third-party integrations)

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Metrics Collection

You can extend the eBPF monitoring program to track additional metrics:

1. Add new data structures to the BPF C program
2. Create new event processing functions
3. Add Prometheus metrics for the new events

Example of adding a new metric for tracking query queue time:

```python
# In the MongoDBEBPFMonitor class
self.prom_metrics['query_queue_time'] = Histogram(
    'mongodb_query_queue_time_seconds', 
    'Time queries spend in queue before execution',
    ['collection']
)

# Add corresponding BPF structures and event handlers
```

### Customizing Alert Thresholds

Alert thresholds can be customized in the Prometheus rules configuration:

```yaml
- alert: MongoDBHighQueryLatency
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(mongodb_query_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 0.5
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "High query latency (instance {{ $labels.instance }})"
    description: "MongoDB 95th percentile query latency is high (> 500ms) for more than 5 minutes."
```

### Integration with APM Tools

The monitoring solution can be integrated with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools:

- **Datadog**: Use the Prometheus integration to import metrics
- **New Relic**: Use the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration
- **Elastic APM**: Use Metricbeat to collect Prometheus metrics
- **Dynatrace**: Use the Prometheus integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot find kernel headers" error**
   ```
   Solution: Install appropriate kernel headers
   sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   ```

2. **"Permission denied" error**
   ```
   Solution: Run with sudo or proper privileges
   sudo python3 ebpf-mongodb-monitoring.py
   ```

3. **"Failed to attach kprobe" error**
   ```
   Solution: Check kernel compatibility and available kprobes
   sudo cat /proc/kallsyms | grep <function_name>
   ```

4. **Cannot connect to MongoDB**
   ```
   Solution: Verify URI and credentials
   python3 -c "import pymongo; pymongo.MongoClient('your-uri')"
   ```

5. **No data appearing in Grafana**
   ```
   Solution: Check Prometheus target status and scraping
   curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
   ```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check if eBPF monitoring agent is running
sudo systemctl status mongodb-ebpf-monitor

# View agent logs
sudo journalctl -u mongodb-ebpf-monitor

# Verify Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets

# Check Prometheus alert rules
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules

# Test AlertManager configuration
amtool check-config /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

## Performance Impact

The eBPF monitoring solution is designed to have minimal impact on production workloads:

- CPU overhead: Typically < 2% on monitored hosts
- Memory usage: ~150-300MB depending on configuration
- Disk I/O: ~10-50MB/hour for metrics storage
- Network impact: Negligible

Performance impact can be further reduced by:
- Adjusting sampling rates for high-volume events
- Limiting the number of monitored collections
- Using a dedicated monitoring instance for large deployments

## Security Considerations

Since eBPF programs run with kernel privileges, several security measures are implemented:

- Run monitoring as a dedicated service account
- Limit eBPF program scope to MongoDB processes only
- Encrypt sensitive data in configuration files
- Implement secure authentication for all components
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
